# The parts that make the Positron LT so great (BOM) [<sub>(back)</sub>](../../../)
>Note: None of these parts need to be machined! Everything can be bought, some parts might need to be shortened with a saw, and some holes need to be drilled, so only basic tools are required.

:exclamation: **These parts are not complete. Heatbed, Printhead and Extruder assemblies are missing.** :exclamation:

**You can also find the "bill of materials" (BOM) as a .CSV [here](./bom.csv).**

### MAKERBEAM:
Since Makerbeam does not sell beams with the needed length, they can either be cut by makerbeam which costs 3.50€ per cut, you can find that service here:  [link](https://www.makerbeam.com/cut-and-tap-for-10x10mm.html) , or you can cut them by yourself. Either way, you need to buy beams that are able be cut in the desired lengths for which we created a cutting plan that can be found here: [link](https://github.com/Fliens/Positron_LT/blob/main/Parts/MakerbeamCuts.png)
