# The parts that make the Positron LT so great (BOM)
>Note: None of these parts need to be machined! Everything can be bought, some parts might need to be shortened with a saw, and some holes need to be drilled, so only basic tools are required.

You can also find the "bill of materials" (BOM) as a csv [here](./bom.csv).
