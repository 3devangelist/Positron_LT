The Positron-LT is a printer made for everyone, especially hobbyists and professionals who don't want to or can't use machined parts.
This printer is a [RepRap](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap) version based on the innovative [Positron V3](https://github.com/KRALYN/PositronV3) formfactor and motion-system which was created by [KRALYN](https://github.com/KRALYN/PositronV3).

**Although the printer is printed, it can still be folded and thus still fits into a filament box. Thus, there are no disadvantages compared to the original, it may even have some improvements**

> Note: This project is a work in progress! The primary design is ready, updates and changes will be made continuously.

<br>

## LT
**LT** stands for **L**igh**T** 
Since the printer is made of printed parts instead of machined parts, it is lighter than the original Positron V3.

- Lighter to source
- Lighter to build
- Lighter to transport

<br>

## Advantages 

- No Machined Part
-	All mechanical parts can be sourced on websites like AliExpress, Amazon or your local hardware store.
- Much less parts to assemble than the V3
- Integrated PSU (power supply unit) with 200W
- 3mm GT2 timing belt on XY (cheaper and easier to source as the original Synchromesh wire)
- The base chassis is made of 10x10 [Makerbeam](https://www.makerbeam.com/makerbeam/) extrusions and other [Makerbeam](https://www.makerbeam.com/makerbeam/) parts. **All other structural parts can be printed!**
- Simplified Z axis by using a leadscrew. Easy to assemble by folding up
- Improved toolhead cooling
- could be used with larger XY Stepper motors up to 26mm

# RepRap
RepRap means that most parts of the printer can be printed and nothing needs to be machined. Only basic tools like a drill or a saw are needed. All other parts are readily available and can be bought online or might even be available in a hardware store.
