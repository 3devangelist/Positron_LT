This printer is a [RepRap](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap) version of the [Positron V3 Pinter](https://github.com/KRALYN/PositronV3) created by KRALYN. **It can still be taken apart and folded so that it fits into a filament carton!**

<br>

## RepRap
RepRap means that most parts of the printer can be printed and nothing needs to be machined. Only basic tools like a drill or a saw are needed. All other parts are readily available and can be bought online or might even be available in a hardware store.

## LT
Since the printer is made of printed parts instead of machined parts, it is lighter than the original Positron V3. Therefore, LT stands for light.
